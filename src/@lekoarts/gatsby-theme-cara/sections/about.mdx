> Simply put, a soccer fan & gamer turned into a software engineer who was very lucky and grateful for all the opportunities. 

From pushing boundaries and making the nearly impossible possible, long nights of learning-by-doing sessions turned into years of experience.

Who would have expected that? Now I can proudly claim to have the honor of holding a scholarship and working since several years at a company where I can make a difference.
